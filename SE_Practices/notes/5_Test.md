# Testing
Testing your code is essential before deployment. 
It helps you catch errors and faulty conclusions before they make any major impact. 

Today, employers are looking for data scientists with the skills to properly prepare their code for an industry setting, 
which includes testing their code.

Problems that could occur in data science aren’t always easily detectable:
- bad encoding
- features being used inappropriately
- unexpected features

To catch these errors, you have to check:
- the quality and accuracy of your analysis
- the quality of your code

Solution: Test Driven Development =)

UNIT TEST: a type of test that covers a “unit” of code, usually a single function, 
independently from the rest of the program.

We will learn:
- write unit tests
- tools to imrpve unit tests
- tests specifically for data science
