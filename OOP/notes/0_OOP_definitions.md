# Object Oriented Programming - OOP

- class - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes
- object - an instance of a class. ex: a yellow pencil, a small dog
- attribute - a descriptor or characteristic. ex: blue, 3 inches 
- method - an action that a class or object could take
- encapsulation - you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, 
this single entity is called a class.  


Example: 

    Object: Stephen Hawking, Brad Pitt
    Class: Scientist, Actor
    Attribute: Color, Size, Shape 
    Method: To rain, To sing
    Value: Gray, Large
    
Example2:

    A shirt has its own color (yellow) and size (S)
    A shirt (magically :)) can change its price. 
    
    Shirt is an object.
    
    It has attributes (color and size) and method-action (change price)
    It has values for attributes. 
    
    If you describe the requirements of shirt with attributes and methods;
    this is your class.
