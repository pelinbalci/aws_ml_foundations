This exercise aims to write a gaussian class. I've adapted the descriptions to my own files:

'Read through the code and fill out the TODOs. You'll find a test.py containing unit tests.
 After you've run the test.py with the Gaussian class, you can run the final cell to check that your code functions 
 as expected.

This exercise includes a file called 'numbers.txt'. The 'numbers.txt' file is read in by the read_data_file() method.'
